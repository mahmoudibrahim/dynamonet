# What is DynamoNet? #

**DynamoNet** is a **Matlab** toolbox that allows users to simulate and analyze networks with time-varying topology. It is mainly intended to serve **systems biologists** working on **interactomes** like protein interaction networks, gene networks...etc. Some functions enable users to **export/import network** into formats suitable for visualization and analysis in other software, mainly **Cytoscape**.
